This principle is called offset function (see example 1).\n1. The part of the amount placed on the Offset card account, which exceeds 50% of the current balance of the loan, will not be taken into account when charging interest. Accordingly, the user saves a maximum of 50% of the interest charged on the current loan balance through the offset function (see example 2)\n2. The offset function applies only to mortgage loans issued in GEL*\n3.

For the offset function to work, it is necessary that the currency of the amount placed on the offset card account is identical to the currency of the loan\n4. The user can view the amount saved with the offset function in Mobile Bank, Internet Bank and Service Center.\n* Note: the operation of the offset function in foreign currency has been limited for loans issued from September 6, 2021. This change will not affect loans existing before the mentioned date. ______________________________________________________________________________________\nExample 1\nIf the borrower's current liability is 10,000 GEL, and 2,000 GEL is placed on the universal account of the offset card, then interest will be accrued only on 8,000 GEL (10,000-2,000=8,000).\nExample 2\nUnder the conditions of the same obligation, if the borrower deposits 6,000 GEL in the universal account, then the above method of interest accrual will be applied only to 50% of the current balance of the loan, i.e. 5,000 GEL. 5,000 GEL will be charged interest as usual.\n________________________________________________________________________________\nOffset function is a real opportunity to reduce interest expenses - the more the amount placed on the offset card account, the less interest the user will have to pay. In addition, the user can use the amount placed on the offset card account without limitation at any time (taking into account the standard withdrawal rates in the bank).\nThe Offset function applies to all types of mortgage loans issued by the Bank of Georgia in GEL.\nFor several loans issued to one client, the offset function will work according to the principle of proportionality (see example 3).\n \n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nExample 3\n \nLet's say, the borrower's current liability for one mortgage loan amounts to 7000 GEL, for a parallel mortgage loan 3000 GEL. Offset card account If 1000 GEL is deposited, the interest will be charged as follows:\n7000 GEL is 70% of the total liability, i.e. 10,000 GEL (7000/10,000%=70%). Accordingly, 70% of the 1000 GEL placed in the account will be used for a 7000 GEL loan, i.e. 700 GEL will not be charged, and since 3000 GEL is 30% of the total liability, 30% of 1000 GEL will be used for a 3000 GEL loan, i.e. 300 GEL % will not be charged.\n \n \nOld condition offset function\nWhen charging interest on the loan issued until June 22, 2018, the part of the balances placed on the universal account(s) exceeding 75% of the current balance of the loan was not taken into account (that is, the offset worked under this condition from the beginning and was replaced by a 50% saving from the mentioned date)\nIn case of granting a new loan to the client in parallel with the loan granted before the above-mentioned date:\n \n \n1. The balances placed on the offset card account(s) will first provide the interest benefit benefit for the new loan (only if the currency of the loan and the balances on the account(s) are identical), and then provide the interest benefit for the loans issued up to and including June 22, 2018 , regardless of their currency.\nIf one client has two loans, one of which is issued up to and including June 22, 2018 (with 75% savings, in all currencies), and the other after June 22, 2018, the offset will work as follows: the offset will first save the interest on the new loan, and the remaining amount (if any) will be applied to the old loan to save interest. This will be written in the client's contract as well (see example 4)\n2. If one client has two loans, one of which is issued before June 22, 2018 (with 75% savings, in all currencies), and the other after June 22, 2018, the offset will work as follows: with the offset, the interest on the new loan will be saved first, and The remaining amount (if any) will be used to save interest on the old loan. This will be written in the client's contract as well (see example 4)\n * When the currencies of the balances on the loan and offset card account(s) differ, the balances will automatically provide the benefit of the interest benefit of the loan issued up to June 22, 2018 (see example", "start_char_idx": 189095, "end_char_idx": 193281, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d97f424f-1a8e-4038-8c09-74161f496741": {"__data__": {"id_": "d97f424f-1a8e-4038-8c09-74161f496741", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b95ec425-96be-4e4d-b9fb-d7aeeec20f96", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a55c78db60bdf4fa75bde3c0575a8c633ec25d83b2dd881ba8ebbb0af5e8ff6"}, "2": {"node_id": "5bb6312c-c092-4e97-b1ad-be5757e09be1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c5434892230e1cc9eccb72d8d69a13d8aca5ba99ebdc6518e5a235b8da040949"}, "3": {"node_id": "e2fd9365-b3a2-4c08-842b-8f1fc9d5c1cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7b4edaa5b876ce3c38df435a395a2faa1ffa0333c29d7abafaf93db9c25db350"}}, "hash": "a4f3ad8a181930a246cc2f9161492672277d8d01b595dedb122617d924912730", "text": "the benefit of the interest benefit of the loan issued up to June 22, 2018 (see example 5).\n \n______________________________________________________________________________________\nExample 4\nLet's say, the customer has 50,000 USD issued under the old scheme (i.e. up to and including June 22, 2018), 100,000 GEL issued under the new scheme (i.e. after June 22, 2018), and 60,000 GEL is owed on the offset. According to the offset principle, 50,000 GEL will be saved as interest on the 100,000 GEL loan, and the remaining 10,000 GEL will be saved as interest on the old loan.\nExample 5\n \nSay, the customer has 50,000 dollars issued under the old scheme, 100,000 GEL issued under the new scheme, and 25,000 US dollars is on offset.

The bank offers deposits of different types and conditions to customers based on their different needs.\nDeposit types\nDeposits are divided into term and demand deposits.\n \nTerm Deposits\nA term deposit agreement involves placing money for a specific period. Term deposits are of three types:\n1. A time deposit is advantageous if the user has savings that he does not plan to change (add or spend) for a certain period of time and only wants to keep it safely and receive high benefits.\n2. Accumulating deposit is intended for the user who wants to open a deposit with small savings for a certain period of time and start collecting money to achieve the set goal. Or the user already owns certain savings to which he periodically plans to add money.\n3. A children's deposit is the best condition if the user wants to ensure a successful future for his child and accumulate money.\n \nDemand Deposit\n \nDemand deposit means opening the contract for life.\nThere are two types of demand deposits:\n \n1. Before the request\n2. Premium - for SOLO users\n The demand deposit is intended for the customer who has savings that he does not need temporarily and does not want for a specific period of time save. However, the user wants to add or spend money at any time.\n  \nOpening a deposit/adding money\nThe customer can open a deposit both in cash and in non-cash form. Deposit can be opened at any service center, with Express Pay payment machine (collectible deposit only), iBank, mBank. Deposits opened with iBank and mBank are accrued more benefits. It is possible to add money to the existing deposit: from any service center, with iBank/mBank and Express Pay payment machine. It is possible to add money to the deposit from the contact center only for SOLO and blind users.\n \nIn the absence of additional contributions to the term (collectible/children's) deposit during the term of the agreement, the agreement will not be violated.\nThe amount added to the deposit with the Express Pay payment device will be considered as a cash deposit.\n \nInterest or interest accrual\n \nDeposit interest rates are determined only in the currencies of GEL, USD, EUR, GBP, CHF. If the user opens a deposit in a currency other than these 5 currencies, the interest rate must be additionally agreed with the Treasury Department.\nWhen opening a deposit, depending on the different conditions of the deposit, the periodicity of receiving benefits is defined in the contract. On the amount placed on the user's deposit, the bank calculates the benefit to be received by the user with daily precision and credits it to the account on the date of receiving the interest - that is, % is capitalized.\nThere are two methods of interest accrual: simple accrual and difficult accrual.\nSimple accrual refers to the accrual of interest on the principal amount of the deposit, i.e. the customer's amount.\nExample #1.\nThe customer has opened a term deposit on the condition of receiving monthly benefits. % will be capitalized every one month from the date of deposit opening. The accrued benefit will not be added to the principal amount of the deposit and the user will use it as he wishes. Further interest will be calculated on the principal amount of the deposit.\nCompound accrual refers to the accrual of interest both on the principal amount of the deposit and on the interest accrued by the bank.\nExample #2.\nThe customer has opened a demand deposit, on which interest is charged monthly.

Due to various circumstances, the customer may need to withdraw the amount placed on the time deposit earlier than the set period, for which the contract of the time deposit will be canceled.

Which means that the amount placed on a deposit opened by an individual in any bank is insured by LSI \"Deposit Insurance Agency\". In the event of an insurance event (when the bank in case of insolvency, liquidation, or bankruptcy is no longer able to return the funds belonging to the depositors), the agency will reimburse the customer in each bank a maximum of 15,000 GEL (in equivalent currency). The user does not pay for insurance.\nVerbal information about deposit insurance is obligatory provided to the customer. General information and questions and answers are also available on the bank's website at bankofgeorgia.ge/retail/ge/deposits. The customer can get detailed information at the deposit insurance agency.

The increased \"effective interest rate\" or 7.2% is the assumption that you open the deposit for a short period of three months, so you will receive your principal and accrued interest in a short period of time.\nThis gives you the opportunity to reap the benefits of the received money.\n\nExample II:\n12-month deposit in GEL - subject to withdrawal of benefits at the end of the term\n\nEmployee:\nMr./Ms. X, the annual interest rate on your deposit is 9.25%. Because the deposit does not have any costs, such as, for example, withdrawal fees, monthly service fees, etc. At the end of the term, you will receive your principal with full interest. In this case, the effective interest rate is 9.25%.\nWhen the deposit is opened with a term of 1 year and accrual at the end of the benefit period, the interest rate and the effective interest rate are equal to each other.\n\nExample III:\n12-month deposit in GEL, subject to monthly interest withdrawal:\n\n\nIf a 1-year deposit is opened subject to monthly interest withdrawal, the effective interest rate is higher.\nEmployee:\nMr/Mrs X, The annual interest rate on your deposit is 9.5%, and the effective interest rate is 9.9%. Because you\nYou have the opportunity to withdraw monthly and enjoy the % charged on the deposit, the increased effective interest rate comes out more.

The effective interest rate is 9.3%. efficient in calculating large\nThe term of the deposit and the periodicity of receiving benefits are important. In this case, the effective reduction is calculated on the assumption that you have deposited the deposit amount in the bank for 18 months. Therefore, in this period, you do not get any other benefits with the mentioned amount, except for the accrued interest, therefore the effective interest rate has decreased. However, this is only an assumption.\nIn fact, the bank will charge you a fairly high interest rate on an 18-month deposit, and at the end of the term, you are guaranteed to receive your principal amount along with the 9.5% interest charged on it.\nNoteworthy:\nThe calculator may miscalculate the effective interest rate on an 18-month deposit. Therefore, when providing initial information to the customer orally, it is important for the employee to note that the given % is approximate. In general, the interest period When calculating the IRR of deposits opened with the condition of final withdrawal, the term of the deposit does not matter. An increase in the term of the deposit reduces the effective interest rate. After the customer decides to open a deposit, the employee registers the deposit in the banking program. After that, it is possible to provide the customer with accurate information about the effective interest rate. Corresponding information is also fixed on the printed header from the banking program.\n\nExample V:\nCollectable deposit - currency risk\nIn the case of collectible deposits, the following entry can be used for currency risk.\nEmployee:\nMr./Ms. X, by mentioning \"currency risk\" we are simply informing you of the following:\nIf we assume that by the time you withdraw the amount, the exchange rate of GEL will strengthen by 15% in relation to the currency of your deposit, the amount of your deposit converted to GEL with accrued benefits will be less than it is today. But this is just a guess and an assumption. At any time, you will receive exactly the principal amount of the deposit, along with the interest accrued on it.\n\nDemand deposit in GEL\n\nUser:\nWhat does an \"effective interest rate\" of 3.5% mean? So you will charge 3.5 percent of my money?\nEmployee:\nMr./Ms. X, \"Effective interest rate\" includes the financial cost you incur when withdrawing your money and the interest accrued on it. When calculating the effective interest rate, a conditional assumption is made that you will not reduce your amount for 1 year and You won't add anything either. After 1 year, you will withdraw the principal, along with the benefit accrued on it, from another service center. In such a case, you will be charged a withdrawal fee. This cost is included in the \"effective interest rate\" and that's why it came out to be 3.5 percent. However, if you cash out your amount and accrued benefits from the same service center - you will not have this expense anymore and nothing will be deducted from the amount you receive.\n\nDemand deposit in foreign currency\n \n\nUser:\nWhat does an \"effective interest rate\" of 1.4% mean?

Deposit conversion\n \n \n \n \nThe depositor has the opportunity to convert the amount placed on the deposit into the desired currency at will without violating the contract, to keep the accrued interest and to avoid financial costs related to currency risks.\nThe deposit can be converted at any service center. If the loan is provided with the security of the deposit, the conversion will be done in the standard service center and solo lounge.\nConversion conditions:\nDeposit type:\ndue date\ncollectable\nChildren's\nconverts to:\n  Both the principal of the deposit and the receivables % accrued on the date of conversion\n During the conversion, depending on the type of deposit, the amount of the minimum amount established for opening the deposit must be maintained.\n For example: a 1000 GEL term deposit cannot be converted into US dollars, since as a result of the conversion we will not receive 500 US dollars (the mandatory minimum amount of the deposit).\nConversion rate:\nat a commercial rate\nat a discounted rate\n Only the principal amount of the deposit can be converted at the offered rate. The preferential rate does not apply to the benefits received.\nConversion currency:\nAll currencies in which the convertible deposit is opened\nFor example: the collectable deposit is opened in GEL. It can be converted to either USD or EUR or GBP.\nPeriodicity of receiving benefits on the converted deposit:\nThe interest on the converted deposit will be accrued at the same period as it was accrued on the deposit before the conversion.\nBenefits when converting children's deposit The capitalization period does not change. Capitalization is produced initially, every subsequent 360 days from the opening of the valid deposit before conversion.\nConversion rate:\nin any quantity\n During the day - only once\nClosing/Termination of the Converted Deposit Agreement:\ndepositor:\nwill close - at the end of the term\nViolates - when full or partial withdrawal of the amount before the deadline. In addition, if the depositor had withdrawn the interest in advance or withdrew it monthly, the excess interest will be deducted from the main amount of the deposit.\n  Loan secured by converted deposit:\nallowed\n  \nDuring conversion, the term of the deposit remains unchanged and the interest rate determined for the type of deposit and currency at the time of conversion will be charged.\nExample #1\nOn 15.01.2020, the user opened a time deposit in GEL for one year. Accordingly, the end date of the deposit is 15.01.2021. 6 months after the opening, on 15.06.2020, he converted the deposit to US dollars. The dollar deposit will also expire on 15.01.2021.

Conversion into GEL is also not acceptable for him, because he actually needs the money in foreign currency. At this time, the user has to convert foreign currency into GEL, then perform an operation (deposit/withdrawal/transfer) in GEL with the desired destination, and then purchase foreign currency again. During these conversions, he loses money due to the exchange rate difference.\nIn such a case, the bank offers the customer simultaneous buying and selling operations, during which the above-mentioned conversions are performed not at commercial, but at preferential rates, which are much less expensive for the customer.\nThe rates of simultaneous buying and selling operations are established by the Treasury Department.\nDuring deposits/withdrawals, one of the conversions is always performed at the National Bank rate, and the other conversion at the SEB rate -0.4% or SEB rate +0.4%. The commission is not imposed on the simultaneous purchase and sale operation - the bank receives income through the exchange rate spread. Before performing the operation, it is mandatory to contact the Treasury Department and agree on the operation in order to insert the preferential rate in the cash conversion form and certify the non-cash conversion performed at the SEB rate.\nDuring the transfer, both conversions are done at the rate of the National Bank.

The effective annual interest rate is 9%.\nCustomer: So the bank will charge me 9% on the deposit?\nEmployee: Mr./Ms. X, the bank will charge you 8.7% on the deposit. The increased \"effective interest rate\" of 9% is the assumption that you have a short-term deposit, with three months of withdrawal. Therefore, you will receive your principal and accrued interest in a short period of time. This allows you to reinvest your money and reap the benefits of the money you receive.\nExample II:\n12-month collectable deposit in GEL - subject to withdrawal at the end of the benefit period\n\nThe annual interest rate and the effective interest rate on the deposit opened with a term of 1 year and with the condition of withdrawal at the end of the benefit period are equal to one.\nEmployee:\nThe annual interest rate of your deposit is 9.3% and since the deposit has no costs such as withdrawal fees, monthly service fees, etc., at the end of the term, you will receive your principal amount along with the accrued interest for sure.\nIn this case, the effective interest rate is 9.3%.\n\nExample III:\n12-month collectable deposit in GEL, subject to monthly withdrawal of benefits\n\n1 year old The effective interest rate on the deposit opened with the term and monthly interest withdrawal is higher than the annual interest rate.\nEmployee:\nThe annual interest rate on your deposit is 8.9%, and the effective interest rate is 9.3%. Since you have the opportunity to withdraw every month and enjoy the % charged on the deposit, the effective interest rate is higher. In this case, there is an assumption that the amount you receive every month can bring benefits again.\n\nExample IV:\n18-month deposit in GEL, subject to withdrawal at the end of the benefit period\n\n\nEmployee: Mr./Ms. X, Your deposit will be credited with an annual interest rate of 9.65%. The effective annual interest rate is 9.4%.\n\nCustomer: That is, the bank will charge me 9.4% on the deposit?\n\nEmployee: The bank will charge you 9.65% per annum on your deposit. In the effective calculation, the term of the deposit and the periodicity of receiving benefits are of great importance. In this case, the effective reduction is calculated on the assumption that you have placed the deposit amount in the bank for 18 months, and therefore, apart from the accrued interest, you do not receive any other benefit.

The effective annual interest rate is 6.9%.\nCustomer: So the bank will charge 6.9% to my amount?\nEmployee: The bank will charge you 7% per annum on your deposit. The \"effective interest rate\" includes the financial cost that you will incur when withdrawing your money and the interest accrued on it.\nIf you have an active plastic card and you neither reduce nor add anything to the amount for 1 year, the effective interest rate of the deposit will be calculated on the assumption that you will transfer the amount from the demand deposit to the plastic card and use it only through payment transactions.\nAs you know, you will not be charged a fee for payment transactions, and you will only have to make an annual deposit on demand You will pay a service fee. In the \"effective interest rate\" this cost is taken into account, and that is why it came out slightly less than the nominal one.\n\n\nWhen calculating the effective interest rate of the premium deposit, the SOLO package fee is included in the financial costs. Since, the prerequisite for using the premium deposit is always the presence of the SOLO package, and no other user can use the pre-request type deposit with similar conditions.\nAccordingly, the premium deposit's financial costs always include the 1-month fee of the lowest-priced SOLO package (in this case, SOLO X package, 18 or 23 GEL depending on the residency), regardless of which package the user owns.\n\nExample VI\nIn the case of deposits opened in foreign currency, regarding the currency risk, the customer is addressed with the following script:\nEmployee: Mr./Ms. X, By mentioning \u201cForeign Exchange Risk\u201d we are simply informing you of the following:\nAt the time of your withdrawal, if we assume that the GEL exchange rate will strengthen by 15% in relation to the currency of your deposit, the amount of your deposit converted to GEL with accrued benefits will be less than it is today.

Prioritization of overdrafts and balances\n \n \n \nAfter the customer approves the overdraft, it is important to determine the sequence of spending the balances or overdraft offered by the bank.\nThere are two spending schemes on universal accounts:\n1. Prioritization of balances - spend your own funds first and then the bank's funds\n2. Overdraft priority - spend in the following order:\n \nTransaction currency balance \u2192 own overdraft (if any) \u2192\nMain currency balance \u2192 own overdraft (if any) \u2192\nOther currency balances \u2192 own overdrafts (if any)\n \nWhen a user registers in the bank, balances are automatically prioritized, although the spending scheme can be changed at any time.\nThe spending scheme chosen by the user will apply equally to all his plastic cards.\nSpending scheme - balance priority:\nExample #1.\nThe customer has a Visa card with an overdraft limit of 1000 GEL. The balances in the account are:\n \n1. 10 GEL\n2. 200 USD\n3. 0 euros\n4. 0 pounds\n \nIn case of payment of 200 GEL by card, the amount will be deducted in the following order:\n1. The operation amount of 200 GEL will be completely deducted from the GEL account;\n2. Since there is not enough balance on the GEL account, a liability (-190) will arise on the account, which will be covered from the US dollar account at the end of the day;\nBecause the user's own funds are sufficient to carry out the operation, The overdraft limit will not be applied.\n Example #2.\nThe customer has a Visa card with an overdraft limit of 1000 GEL. The balances in the account are:\n \n1. 10 GEL\n2. 0 USD\n3. 0 euros\n4. 0", "start_char_idx": 907564, "end_char_idx": 911476, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "914946f3-f86e-401c-b97d-c5fd050f2a92": {"__data__": {"id_": "914946f3-f86e-401c-b97d-c5fd050f2a92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b95ec425-96be-4e4d-b9fb-d7aeeec20f96", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a55c78db60bdf4fa75bde3c0575a8c633ec25d83b2dd881ba8ebbb0af5e8ff6"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cb3ac6a-0966-4127-89dc-d6a9fa52dd15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf902268c49a6304fb2b06c5ca0d750447984c79d06113808ebe1b95ddf689d1"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5cba622-82e2-4d62-b813-3854e207bb0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "895e1afd40ab35e61c97668516eaad2f60b8ca0aa66f32ee217092669a281886"}}, "hash": "eb9ab2868b34911211cb5894bb426d2d8c7f428da74c2129ece0aded26a04b09", "text": "10 GEL\n2. 0 USD\n3. 0 euros\n4. 0 pounds\n \nIn case of payment of 200 GEL by card, the amounts will be deducted in the following order: 10 GEL + 190 GEL from the overdraft limit allowed on the same account;\n \nSpending scheme - overdraft priority:\nExample #3.\nThe customer has a Visa card with an overdraft limit of 1000 GEL. The balances in the account are:\n \n1. 0 GEL\n2. 200 USD\n3. 0 euros\n4. 0 pounds\nIn case of payment of 200 GEL by card, the amount of the operation will be deducted directly from the overdraft limit.\n \nTerms of repayment of spent overdraft\nOverdraft repayment is carried out taking into account the following two conditions:\n1. If the user has spent an overdraft, regardless of the chosen spending scheme, the overdraft will be fully or partially covered when depositing/depositing money to the account in the currency of the overdraft.\n2. If the user has spent an overdraft and at the same time has chosen balance priority as the spending scheme, the amount entered/deposited in a currency different from the currency of the overdraft will be automatically converted and the overdraft will be fully or partially covered.\n If the user has spent an overdraft and at the same time has selected overdraft priority as the spending scheme, the amount deposited/deposited in a currency different from the currency of the overdraft will not be automatically converted and Overdraft will not be covered.\nSpent overdraft from other accounts, regardless of the chosen spending scheme, is covered automatically only after its expiry.\n Example #4.\nThe customer is allowed an overdraft of 1,000 GEL. 300 GEL has been spent from this. He does not have his own balance in Lari or other foreign currency accounts. He deposited the loan amount of 500 USD 1 day before the payment date.\nIf the user chooses balance priority as the spending scheme, at the end of the day:\n1. From 500 US dollars, the equivalent of 300 GEL US dollars will be automatically converted and credited to the GEL account to cover the spent overdraft. That is, the balance on the US dollar account will decrease.\n2. On the next day, taking into account the limit, 500 USD will be deducted from the USD account to cover the loan. Due to the lack of sufficient funds in the account, the resulting obligation will be covered by conversion from GEL overdraft.\nThe loan will be repaid, but the customer will suffer double the exchange rate difference in conversions.\nAt the end of the day, if the user chooses overdraft priority as the spending scheme:\n500 US dollars will not be converted to fill the spent GEL overdraft, the loan will be repaid and therefore the customer will not be affected. Allowing overdrafts for users enrolled in the payroll program\n \n \n \nThe bank offers the employees of the organization involved in the payroll program to activate the credit limit on the payroll card in the form of an overdraft. The amount of the approved limit depends on the agreement between the bank and the organization (eg: 90% of salary).\nIn any service center it is possible to pay on the payroll account:\n- allowing overdraft,\n- extension of the overdraft period,\n- increasing the limit,\n- reducing the overdraft limit,\n- Cancellation of overdraft.\nInitial consultation with the customer:\nThe bank employee conducts an initial interview with the customer, informs the overdraft conditions, costs related to it, calculates the effective interest rate with a special calculator.\n \nSoftware registration:\nTo activate the overdraft, the employee performs the following actions:\n  \n1.

Therefore, when taking a loan in foreign currency, a possible change in the exchange rate may increase contributions expressed in GEL. .\nUnder what assumption is the effective interest rate calculated?\nWhen calculating, take into account the percentage of the product and all costs related to its use;\nFor those products, which the client can cash out through an ATM, it is considered that the use of money is always completed by cashing out through an ATM;\nFor products that do not have a fixed term, the term of the product is considered to be a fixed 12 months (credit cards, certain deposits);\nIn those products where the client can absorb different volumes within the limit, it is considered that the limit is fully absorbed (credit cards).\n What are the two types of effective interest rates?\n1) In the case of credit cards:\nIt is allowed that the customer withdraws the amount through an ATM;\nIt is allowed that the client spends the amount in full through payments at partner facilities;\n2) If the product is issued in foreign currency:\ndeposits In case it is assumed that the GEL strengthens by 15% every year and the client is provided with information on how his effective interest will change if the GEL strengthens by 15% every year during the existence of the product;\nIn the case of a credit product, it is allowed that the GEL depreciates by 15% every year, and the client is provided with information on how his effective interest will change if the GEL depreciates by 15% every year during the product's existence (see example).\nFor example, you take out a loan of 1000 USD for one year at 15% per annum. You cover the loan amount with equal monthly installments that amount to USD 90.26. Also, let's assume that the loan exchange rate is 1 USD = 2.1 GEL. Then, the initial amount of the loan in GEL equivalent will be 2100 GEL (1000 USD * 2.10).\nIf 15% equal devaluation of GEL occurs within one year, then the effective interest rate (IRR) calculated in GEL will be 34.8%.\nDate\nloan amount\nin dollars\ncurrency\ncourse\nLoan amount in", "start_char_idx": 1021730, "end_char_idx": 1025784, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "556f1c7c-fd8b-4cac-ba8c-cedbcd0fd26b": {"__data__": {"id_": "556f1c7c-fd8b-4cac-ba8c-cedbcd0fd26b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b95ec425-96be-4e4d-b9fb-d7aeeec20f96", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a55c78db60bdf4fa75bde3c0575a8c633ec25d83b2dd881ba8ebbb0af5e8ff6"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea96f0fb-ef32-48b5-a83d-2a1d92c392cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fee287cc4fc9061c363035c29c115104f0e9871a8754ff1215db0f8a92be0cb3"}, "3": {"node_id": "5869defc-0d22-4c28-9e37-09faafb0d752", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b41b63930719811a07c0a66c163de4f83a4fa72c09f66c80bd293bfcce508bb"}}, "hash": "b984a5e758e14ca085d81a2f5e2e104d1b1c13d47a8445f670502f08df75f9d4", "text": "amount\nin dollars\ncurrency\ncourse\nLoan amount in GEL\n10/12/2014\n1000 USD\n2.10\n2100 GEL\n  monthly\nAmount to be paid\nin dollars\n1$=\nMonthly payable amount in GEL\n15% annual depreciation of the course\ncase (i.e. 1.25% per month on average)\n10/01/2015\n90.26 USD\n2.1263\n191.92 GEL\n10/02/2015\n90.26 USD\n2.1525\n194.28 GEL\n10/03/2015\n90.26 USD\n2.1788\n196.65 GEL\n10/04/2015\n90.26 USD\n2.2050\n199.02 GEL\n10/05/2015\n90.26 USD\n2.2313\n201.39 GEL\n10/06/2015\n90.26 USD\n2.2575\n203.76 GEL\n10/07/2015\n90.26 USD\n2.2838\n206.13 GEL\n10/08/2015\n90.26 USD\n2.3100\n208.50 GEL\n10/09/2015\n90.26 USD\n2.3363\n210.87 GEL\n10/10/2015\n90.26 USD\n2.3625\n213.24 GEL\n10/11/2015\n90.26 USD\n2.3888\n215.61 GEL\n10/12/2015\n90.26 USD\n2.4150\n217.98 GEL\nEffective\nInterest rate\nrate\nIRR = 17.0%\n  IRR expressed in GEL = 34.8%\n\nBased on the example, although the monthly payment amount in US dollars is fixed and amounts to 90.26 US dollars, in the conditions of equal depreciation of the exchange rate at an average of 15% per year, the monthly contribution expressed in GEL will constantly increase (see graph).

Certificates of Deposit\n \n \n \n \nThe bank offers a certificate of deposit to customers who want to place their savings reliably and for a long time in the bank in order to receive high interest benefits.\nA certificate of deposit is a security that represents the bank's obligation to pay the customer the amount specified in the certificate, that is, the nominal value of the certificate, on the date determined by the certificate. To purchase a certificate of a specific nominal value, the user pays an amount called the settlement amount.\nDeposit certificate interest rates are determined only in the currencies of GEL, USD, EUR, GBP, CHF. If the user opens a certificate in a currency other than these 5 currencies, the interest rate must be additionally agreed with the Treasury Department.\nThe Bank of Georgia offers two types of deposit certificates to individuals - discount and interest-bearing:\n \n1. Discount - its settlement amount is less than the nominal value. At the end of the term, the user withdraws the face value of the certificate. The difference between the face value and the settlement amount is the customer's benefit.\n2. Interest, the same as coupon - its settlement amount is equal to the nominal value and the user has the choice of periodicity of receiving benefits.\n \n Example #1.\n The customer wants to purchase a 7000 denomination discount certificate of deposit in US dollars with a maturity of 3 years. For this he needs to bring in 6167 USD, (settlement amount), which is considered programmatic. At the end of the term, the customer will cash out $7,000. The difference between the face value of the certificate and the settlement amount - 833 USD is the customer's benefit.\nThe customer wants to purchase a 5000 nominal interest certificate in GEL, with the condition of monthly withdrawal of benefits, for a period of 2 years. For this he needs to bring 5000 GEL (settlement amount). The user will receive benefits every month until the end of the term and will cash out 5000 GEL at the end of the term.\n \nThe deposit certificate is distinguished by the flexibility characteristic of securities. The owner of the certificate can sell it, redeem it or give it as a gift during the term of the contract.
